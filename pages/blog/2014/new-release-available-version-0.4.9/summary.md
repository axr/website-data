Hey everyone!

After a couple of months of slow progress, finally we have our next release out
of the door: 0.4.9. It adds many new features and massive improvements under
the hood.

I hope you guys can take it for a ride and discover bugs, write tests and in
general let us know what you think, feedback is very much appreciated. Head
over...
