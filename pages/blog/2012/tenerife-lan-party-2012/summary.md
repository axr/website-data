After a fun-packed, awesome and exhausting weekend, I'm back home. For all of
you that couldn't attend (which I guess is 99.9% of the people who read this),
here's my report of how it went down.

## Overview of the event

As I was told, the TLP is the second-biggest LAN party in Spain, with 1600
participants (with computer, at least twice as much attendees in total) only
behind the one held in the Basque Country, in northern Spain. From the 17th to
22nd July, the 12.000m2 of the International Trade Fair and Congress Centre of
Tenerife became home to a world of Manga/Anime, video games, 3d graphics, retro
consoles and software development.
